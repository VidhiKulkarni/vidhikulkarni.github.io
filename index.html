            <p>Hi, I'm <a href="mailto:vkulkarni65@gatech.edu">Vidhi</a>, a computer science major and <a href="https://stampsps.gatech.edu/about/what-to-expect">Stamps President's Scholar</a> at Georgia Tech with concentrations in <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> and <strong>systems & architecture</strong>. My prior research spans computer graphics, robotics, genomics, metabolomics, and machine learning, tackling challenges in spaceflight, health diagnostics, and real-time monitoring. With a background in computer graphics and embedded programming, I hope to design cutting-edge systems for real-time visualization and intelligent device integration. </p>
