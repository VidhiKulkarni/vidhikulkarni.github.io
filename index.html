            <p>Hi, I'm <a href="mailto:vkulkarni65@gatech.edu">Vidhi</a>, a computer science major and <a href="https://stampsps.gatech.edu/about/what-to-expect">Stamps President's Scholar</a> at Georgia Tech with concentrations in <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> and <strong>systems & architecture</strong>. My prior research spans computer graphics, robotics, genomics, metabolomics, and machine learning, tackling challenges in spaceflight, health diagnostics, and real-time monitoring. With a background in computer graphics and embedded programming, I hope to design cutting-edge systems for real-time visualization and intelligent device integration. </p>

                <p><strong>Implementation of Machine Learning-Based System for Early Diagnosis of Feline Mammary Carcinomas through Blood Metabolite Profiling</strong></p>
                <p>Vidhi Kulkarni, Igor F Tsigelny, Valentia Kouznetsova</p>
                <p>Feline mammary carcinoma (FMC) is a highly aggressive neoplasm with limited diagnostic reliability using conventional methods like imaging and fine-needle aspiration. This study identified key metabolic pathways, such as alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism, along with critical oncogenic genes, including ERBB2, EGFR, and PDGFA, using MetaboAnalyst 5.0 and STRINGdb for metabolomic and proteomic analysis. A machine learning model trained on blood metabolite data demonstrated 85.11% accuracy, highlighting its potential for early, biomarker-driven FMC diagnosis. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39330508/" target="_blank">Read More</a></p>
